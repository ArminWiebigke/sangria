/** Sangria GraphQL server library.
  *
  * Sangria is a library that provides parsing, validation, execution and other services for GraphQL
  * queries.
  *
  * It typically requires other libraries to build a complete GraphQL service—including, perhaps,
  * ones that provide a service interface (e.g.,
  * [[https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/index.html Akka HTTP]]) and a database interface
  * (e.g., [[https://scala-slick.org/ Slick]])—as well as custom code to bridge the gap between data
  * representations that are natural to the database vs. to the GraphQL schema.
  *
  * @see
  *   [[https://sangria-graphql.github.io/ the Sangria home page]]
